We are Sentry. We are a team of videogame enthusiasts with the desire to protect our precious videogames. We are a business-to-business company spearheaded by Marianna with support from Hugo, Yusef, and Joshua. Our goal is to make videogame makers comfortable enough to be able to produce and maintain their games by protecting their games from piracy. Our service will promote stability to our virtual realms and will help build and maintain their entertainment in the long run.  We offer contractual and subscription based service. 

Our specific customer segment will be gaming platforms. We will protect their stored information and monitor their servers as they continue their videogaming work. We offer Best-in-the-World service to the top companies in the industry, such as Steam and EpicGames. We all should understand the importance of data security. These businesses are always under threat and are being attacked by hackers. There is a looming threat of being hacked and having information stolen, which includes games being pirated. The issue that they face as all companies face now, are problems with security. These companies compromise the relationship with their customers and lose money when they are not protected. Enter Sentry; we will provide the necessary tools of people, hardware and software they will need for protection. We are extemely passionate about making gaming safe from piracy and liken ourselves to our favorite videogame protaginists who take part in a noble and epic quest to defeat evil forces who would dare pirate our precious games.  

We hold the protection of property, intellectual or others very dear. The prevention of piracy for different platforms is important as it provides the videogame industry with peace of mind and allows it to concentrate on what they do best which is of course making more videogames for us to conquer. We will help keep information safe and private as it is ethically correct and companies have the right to earn money from their craft. Our products integretes into systems seamslessly and will protect the data.

We offer data security solutions to gaming platforms. We have started development and testing will continue to ensure our services remain  consistent. We can start integrating it into the platforms on a small scale and if necessary will find and swiftly remove any, for the most part unlikely faults. We are very strong at preventing attacks and are able to nullify any encountered threat and help fix and breached items. We will continue to monitor and will not allow any breaches on our watch. We constantly update our policies, procedures, and technology often so that we can meet the new challenges that hackers create everyday. We offer many solutions of variable pricing that should suit most individual firms needs as we understand every firm has different needs. We offer competent services at competitive fees. Our data security solutions will be available primarily through software and will be of greatest value to videogaming companies.

We understand that developers need to have their games protected frompiracy but we must also keep the consumer in mind. We want to make sure they can enjoy their games without our software causing performance issues or requiring an internet connection to constantly check-in. Its a tough challenge to accomplish this, but its one that we continue to work hard on and adapt to with new developments and techniques being implemented when we roll out our updates. Not one problem out of the several we face is the same so being able to adapt is the key to our success. While we talk about protecting the companies making the games, we also understand how important it is to protect the information of those playing the games as well. With several hacks gathering very sensitive information on the people that play the games, we also offer software to companies that protect their consumers. Being a well rounded company that can take on several issues is what will keep us ahead of the competition.
